# Maps-from-the-Oxford-Guide-to-the-Malayo-Polynesian-Languages-of-Southeast-Asia

These are the maps from the Oxford Guide to the Malayo-Polynesian Languages of Southeast Asia. They are made available here for the use of authors and others who may want to use the maps.

While the volume itself is behind a paywall, the maps are liscenced as CC BY-NC 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) meaning you are free to redistribute and adapt the maps, as long as you provide appropriate attribution to the creator (Owen Edwards) and do not use them for commercial purposes. If you are reusing a map in an academic publication or presentation, probably the best way to cite it would be something like: "Map by Owen Edwards from XXX" where XXX is the citation to the the chapter the map appears in.

When I was asked to (re)make the maps, several things were already set and could not be changed. Notably, the size of the maps. If I had have had more freedom, I would have done certain things differently.

Note that in the legend for map 33.2 the names of Boano and Totoli were inadvertantly swapped. Language 19 should be Totoli and language 20 Boano. This has been corrected in the uploaded map here.

If you are further interested in knowing how to make maps, please refer to my map making guide here: https://github.com/OwenAmarasi/Linguistic-Map-Making This was made before I knew how to use patterns, which are employed in these maps.
