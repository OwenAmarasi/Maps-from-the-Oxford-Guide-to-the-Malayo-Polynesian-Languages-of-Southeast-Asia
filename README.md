These are the maps from the Oxford Guide to the Malayo-Polynesian Languages of Southeast Asia. They are made available here for the use of authors and others who may want to use the maps.

While the volume itself is behind a paywall, the maps are liscenced as CC BY-NC 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) meaning you are free to redistribute and adapt the maps, as long as you provide appropriate attribution to the creator (Owen Edwards) and do not use them for commercial purposes.

Note that in the legend for map 33.2 the names of Boano and Totoli were inadvertantly swapped. Language 19 should be Totoli and language 20 Boano. This has been corrected in the uploaded map here.
